# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

# Solution

```c++
vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
	vector<int> goal(26), cur(26), res;
	for(char c : p) goal[c - 'a']++;
	for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
		cur[s[i] - 'a']++;
		if(i >= p.size()) cur[s[i - p.size()] - 'a']--;
		if(cur == goal) res.push_back(i - p.size() + 1);
	}
	return res;
}
```
