# 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View

There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.

Return a list of indices **(0-indexed)** of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: heights = [2,2,2,2]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Buildings cannot see the ocean if there are buildings of the same height to its right.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 109`

# Solution

## Approach 1

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findBuildings(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> output;
        int n = heights.size();
        int max = 0;
        for ( int i = n-1; i > -1; i-- ) {
            if ( heights[i] > max ) {
                output.push_back( i );
                max = heights[i];
            }
        }
        reverse( output.begin(), output.end() );
        return output;
    }
};
```

## Approach 2

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findBuildings(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> output;
        int n = heights.size();
        for ( int i = 0; i < n; ++i ) {
            while ( !output.empty() && heights[ output.back() ] <= heights[i]) {
                output.pop_back();
            }
            output.push_back( i );
        }
        return output;
    }
};
```

## Approach 3

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findBuildings(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> output;
        stack<int> stk;
        int n = heights.size();
        
        for ( int i = n-1; i > -1; --i ) {
            while ( !stk.empty() && heights[stk.top()] < heights[i] ) {
                stk.pop();
            }
            if ( stk.size() == 0 ) {
                output.push_back(i);
            }
            stk.push(i);
        }
        reverse( output.begin(), output.end() );
        return output;
    }
};
```
